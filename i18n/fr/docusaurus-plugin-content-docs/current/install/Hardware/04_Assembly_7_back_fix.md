# Body assembly 7 inch back fix : 
Your plywood body should now be ready.
> To avoid getting your hands and plywood dirty. Clean the laser-cut edges. Laser cutting burns the plywood and forms a layer of carbon.   
- Place the foam protection supplied with the screen on the underside of the front panel :

- Use a Roofing bolt & nut 5X16 to secure the side to the front panel, but do not overtighten :

- Slightly bend the part of the back face to relax the part that will be curved.
>Note:
> - Don't force it, it's wood, not reed. It may break.
> - Wash your hands after this step (there will probably be some carbon released from the small cuts).

- Place the rear panel in the notches (the sides must be able to move slightly, if you have tightened the Roofing bolt & nut 5X16 too much, loosen them slightly).  
![Assembly_14.jpg](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fstatic%2Fimg%2Fpi_diy%2FAssembly_14.jpg)  

- Position the curved part of the rear face, you will have to force a little, but be careful not like a barbarian :)
