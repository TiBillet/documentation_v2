# Body assembly 10inch : 
The assembly procedure remains more or less the same as 7inch back fix, so we'll go through it more quickly .  
The main difference is the screen mounting system,  
but remember:
- don't overtighten the Roofing bolt & nut 5X16
- Use spacers to fix the NFC card.

> Note: you'll need an additional USB-MicroUSB cable, because this time it's not the Pi that powers the screen, but the screen that powers the Pi.

- Place the screen on the foam :

> Be careful not to tighten it too much, as this could press the buttons on the back of the screen.  

- Place the sides in the notches on the front panel and on the VESA plate :

- Place the rear panel in the notches (the sides must be able to move slightly, if you have tightened the Roofing bolt & nut 5X16 too much, loosen them slightly).

- Position the curved part of the rear face, you will have to force a little, but be careful not like a barbarian :)
