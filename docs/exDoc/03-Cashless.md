# Cashless


## Did you say Federated Cashless ?

Cashless is a payment system that allows you to pay for purchases electronically. It comes in the form of a card or bracelet equipped with an NFC (Near Field Communication) chip which allows communication with as many terminals and points of sale as desired.

Cashless is often used at festivals and events to simplify transactions and avoid queues at checkouts.
Participants can recharge their card/bracelet online or on site during the event, at charging stations or completely independently via the QR code printed on their card. Their credits allow them to buy food, drinks or souvenirs on site.

TiBillet cashless is a federated system, meaning it can be used by several event organizers and cultural venues at the same time. Users can therefore use their cashless wallet in different locations and benefit from a card valid for life without activation or reloading fees.
This makes it possible to create a network of cooperators united around a local currency intended 100% for culture, and encourages the circulation of artists and audiences.

Cashless is also very practical for organizers, who can monitor transactions and sales at their event in real time. This allows them to optimize their space management and order preparation, as well as to streamline sales which increase by 30% on average.
Beyond a system well known to festival-goers, TiBillet offers a food hall management solution in addition to its cashless system.

This allows restaurateurs to manage orders, preparations and payments efficiently and in real time.
For example, users can place an order from their table using their NFC card, which is registered in the system and associated with their cashless wallet.

Restaurant owners can also use order terminals to enter orders and print kitchen preparation tickets.

This solution simplifies the catering management and reduces order errors.
It is also suitable for outdoor events, thanks to the possibility of working without an Internet connection.

Finally, TiBillet's cashless system is compatible with most thermal printers and payment terminals, allowing restaurateurs to easily integrate into their existing infrastructure.
