# Online ticketing and booking

TiBillet is a solution that allows you to create in a few clicks a web page presenting events, places, and online ticket sales. An already well-known system to which TiBillet adds cooperation.

Each event is part of the network created by the program instance and tickets can be purchased using the currency of the federated cashless wallet.

By creating an entire network, TiBillet also allows artists and show producers to create a dedicated space, in order to have control over the information they share with the public as well as with artistic organizers and programmers.

## Artist space

With his personal web page created in just a few clicks, the artist, whether emerging or professional, benefits from a completely innovative communication tool which will allow him to highlight his project and very easily approach all the programmers of the network.

This information collected and provided by the artist himself allows the show organizer / programmer to have a very complete tool to manage his programming. In a few seconds he can accesse legal information (intermittency, fee subsidy schemes, number of musicians, special diets, etc) and promotional information about artists (bio, photos, videos, etc), as well as their shared calendar (concert dates, attendance, etc).

## Communication tools

By offering options for managing associative memberships and newsletters, mass-mailing, and automatic publication on social media events, TiBillet sees itself not only as a ticketing service but as a complete event production tool tailor-made by and for the organizers.

# Federated agenda

TiBillet's federated agenda is a tool for promoting cultural events which highlights the various events organized by the instance program's partners.
It is a collaborative tool that allows events in the same region to be grouped together and showcased to a target audience.

Meetings, events, concerts, shows, exhibitions, conferences, workshops, etc... all types of events are accepted in the calendar of an entire territory.
