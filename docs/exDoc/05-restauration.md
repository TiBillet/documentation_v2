# Order taking software

The health crisis has led us to rethink our cashless tool and the management of indoor order taking, in order to correspond to current standards.

Contactless payment using an Android phone and festival-goer's NFC cards allows barrier gestures to be respected and eliminates the need for cash exchanges.

Management of items, inventories, sales, order taking and printing of tickets in the kitchen and at the bar are features developed and integrated into TiBillet. This system can be used as a complete catering management tool.

Using his Android mobile phone, the waiter at the table sends his order directly to the kitchen and/or the bar, and collects the money from the user who has previously loaded his cashless card on the internet. Zero waiting, zero checkout errors, and total order fluidity!

A demonstration version of the interface is available, the information is on [first page](/docs/presentation/introduction#d%C3%A9monstration).
