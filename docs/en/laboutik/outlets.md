Points of sale represent the physical space(s) in your location where a TiBillet box is installed. 
Once in the interface, you can choose the one that concerns you (Bar, Restaurant, Cashless...). 
There you will find the categories and articles assigned to this point of sale.

Thanks to the primary cards which are requested each time the application is opened, you can restrict access to certain points of sale to the users concerned.

## Create a new point of sale

- Click on the “Points of sale” category in the left column.
- Click on the “Add Point of Sale” button at the top right.
- Enter the name of the point of sale as well as the items that will be available
- Save

!!! note
    A point of sale is visible in the interface if it contains articles. 
    It is best to create the items first and then assign them to a point of sale.
