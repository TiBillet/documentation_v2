## Launch

Your device must be NFC compatible.
The application has been tested on the following hardware:

- OnePlus 3T
- Blackview
- Redmi 9
- Redmi Note pro 10

## Pairing

On first launch, indicate:

- the DNS address of your cashless server

     Ask your administrator. This is the address of your administration interface without https:// or /adminstaff
    
     example: `manapanycashless.tibillet.re`

- Give your device an explicit name to be able to find it easily (eg: Redmi9Alex)

A screen with an orange background appears. It tells you the name of the device to validate.
On your administration page, go to the Device section (/adminstaff/APIcashless/device/)

Click “active” then save. Your device is now paired!

On your phone, press the orange screen, the application launches and asks you for your primary card :smile:
