This is where you choose which items will be present in your interfaces as well as their price and the points 
of sale to which they are attached.

## 1- Create a new article

- Click on “Articles and prices” in the left menu.
- Click on the "Add article" button at the top right.
- Enter the sale price.
- The purchase price is used to estimate the profits of an evening displayed on the daily accounting report. This is not a mandatory value.
- Enter the category of the item (This determines how it is displayed on the cashless interface. See Category.)
- Change the text color if you want better display contrast.
- Save

## 2- Add it to a point of sale


- Click on the “Points of sale” category in the left column.
- Click on the name of an existing point of sale to which you want to add your item.
- Enter the articles that will be available in the "Articles" field. You can select several by holding the ctrl key.
- Save

!!! note
    For a point of sale to be visible in the interface, it must contain articles. 
    It is best to create the items first and then assign them to a point of sale.
