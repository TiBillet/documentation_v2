# Graphic design

The graphical identity is still in development but we've got a few elements ready!

## Inspirations

We were looking for something that would represent our ties to the cultural landscape, and distance us from the aesthetics of tech startups and other for-profit technological solutions to social issues. We aggregated two vibes we felt would mesh well together:

<figcaption>

Tickets old and new: ticket design has always been a hallmark of cultural life, from the first date tickets you still keep in a treasure box to Willy Wonka's golden ticket. There are not one but two (üéüÔ∏è!) (üé´!) ticket emoji: everyone knows at first glance what they are and has some fondness for the little paper things.

<figcaption>

Another angle we came at was the island, the archipelago. TiBillet was born in La Reunion (find it on a map!) and has the ambition to connect communities together, little islands of communal life into bigger archipelagos, so to speak.
