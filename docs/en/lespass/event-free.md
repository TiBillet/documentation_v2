To do this, nothing simpler !

## 1- Add or edit an event

- Click on the "Events" category in the left column under the Ticketing tab
If you have not yet created your event, click on the "ADD EVENT +" button at the top right
If your event already exists click on its name in the table
   * it is possible to sort alphabetically, by date or use the search bar
  
- Go to the “Articles” section
- Deselect all products (ctrl + left click)
   * products should no longer be grayed out or highlighted in blue.
  
- Save at the bottom of the page
