# The TiBillet philosophy

TiBillet allows to create a link between the different actors of the territory.

These actors are:

- of collectives
- of audiences
- of professional performers

TiBillet is therefore a unifying toolbox. 

Federator means who creates the link. 

TiBillet helps to develop culture for all in the same region. 

Tibillet is open source. 

Open source means that the source code of TiBillet is usable by everyone. 

I can make changes in TiBillet to meet my specific needs.

TiBillet is created by the Cooperative Code Commun.

The money earned with TiBillet is distributed fairly among the people who work in the cooperative. 

You can enter the co-op.
