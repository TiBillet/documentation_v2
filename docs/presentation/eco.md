# Rates, conditions and licenses to use TiBillet

TiBillet are free software. 

Free software means that:

- I can use it without paying
- I can change it
- other people can use what I have modified

## I’m in the audience: 

I can use the TiBillet card for life. 

I have to respect one condition: use the TiBillet card regularly.

## I am a collective:

The use of the TiBillet tool box is free. 

I don’t have to pay for a subscription. 

The Cooperative Code Commun does not take a percentage or commission on sales and money transactions. 

This means, for example: 

- when you pay with TiBillet card, the Cooperative Code Commun does not take money
- when you buy a ticket on the ticketing, the Cooperative Code Commun does not take money
I am responsible for cash transactions in TiBillet.

I can install TiBillet and use it: 

- without guaranteed operation
- without after-sales service

This means that if it does not work, it is not because of the cooperative Code Commun. 

The material to use TiBillet is chargeable.
For example, cash register and TiBillet cards are paid. 

I have only one condition:

If TiBillet is not used for more than a year, the money in it is given to the Cooperative Code Commun. 

This money is used to finance: 

- Maintenance of the TiBillet tool box
- The activities of the Cooperative Common Code
