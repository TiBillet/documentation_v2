# Social and solidarity-based economic model.

TiBillet is a suite of free/open source software.

We do not charge a subscription or percentage on transactions: 
No commission is taken from sales and 
you receive all of your ticketing and point of sale revenue.

You purchase the equipment you need, at cost price.
We support you in the implementation and use of those tools and we are particularly attentive to your needs and possible custom modifications.

You are still responsible for financial transactions within your establishment (TiBillet does not 
act as a bank) but your users now have a card valid across the entire TiBillet network. 
Their wallet is valid for life, with no subscription or reload fees, provided they use it regularly.

Your events benefit from all of our communication tools (local and federated calendar, social networks, mailing list, etc.) and we regularly invite network users to take advantage of your events throughout the year.

Only condition: to finance the activities of the cooperative and the maintenance of the network, we re-inject part of the money into the wallets which have been inactive for more than a year.

Finally, if you wish, we will invite you to become a member of the cooperative (SCIC) so that you become an integral part of the TiBillet project and its entire network.

# Solo model

You want to use TiBillet tools for your event, your venue or your association but without joining the network ?

No problem: All the TiBillet tools just for you, in a kit sent by post. Contact us !
