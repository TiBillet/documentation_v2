# Create a post manually

It is also possible to create a ticket manually and live, ideal for managing on-site registrations or responding to specific requests without going through the classic online booking process.

To do this:

- Go to the tab **"tickets"** in the left menu
- Click on the **"+"** button in the top right corner
- Complete the form:
  - First name
  - Name
  - email
  - Rate (Select your event related to the price)
  - Choose the payment method
  - Record

The ticket is now created and visible in "tickets".
