# Creating Spaces Without Stripe

**Good news!** You can now create and manage a TiBillet space without needing a Stripe account initially. This makes it easier to get started with TiBillet for free events and basic management.

## How It Works

When creating a new TiBillet space:

1. Fill out the registration form with your organization's details
2. You'll see an option to indicate whether you want to collect payments (tickets, memberships, donations)
3. If you uncheck this option, you can proceed without setting up a Stripe account
4. Your space will be created with limited functionality focused on free events

## What You Can Do Without Stripe

Even without a Stripe account, you can:

- Create and manage free events
- Handle reservations for free tickets
- Manage your organization's information
- Set up event details, locations, and schedules
- Connect a LaBoutik cash register for in-person payments

## Limitations Without Stripe

Without a Stripe account, you won't be able to:

- Accept online payments for tickets
- Process online memberships or subscriptions
- Receive TiBillet federated currency
- Collect donations online

## Adding Stripe Later

You can always add a Stripe account later when you're ready to accept online payments:

1. Go to your administration panel
2. Navigate to the Configuration section
3. Look for the Stripe integration option
4. Follow the onboarding process to connect your Stripe account

## LaBoutik Integration

If you want to accept in-person payments without online payment processing:

1. Check the "LaBoutik cash register" option during registration
2. This allows you to connect a physical point-of-sale system
3. You can accept cash and card payments in person
4. Note that for full functionality, including online payments and TiBillet federated currency, you'll eventually need to create a Stripe account

**Note**: While you can start without Stripe, we recommend setting up a Stripe account eventually to access the full range of TiBillet features, especially if you plan to sell tickets online or participate in the TiBillet federated currency ecosystem.
