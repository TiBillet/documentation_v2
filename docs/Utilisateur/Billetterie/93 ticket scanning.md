# Ticket Scanning in Administration

## Accessing Ticket Management

2. Navigate to **Tickets** in the left menu
3. You'll see a list of all tickets with their status (scanned or not scanned)

## Default Display and Filtering

By default, the system displays only valid tickets (scanned or not scanned). Similarly, the reservations displayed are also valid ones.

You can use the filter button in the admin interface to:
- View all tickets, including invalid ones
- See unsuccessful buy attempts
- Filter by event, options, or other criteria

## Scanning Tickets

The ticket management interface offers several scanning options:

1. **Search for a specific ticket**: Use the search box to find a ticket by UUID, customer name, or email
2. **Scan individual tickets**: Click the "SCAN 1" button next to a ticket to validate it
3. **Scan all tickets from a reservation**: For group entries, click the "SCAN X" button (where X is the number of tickets) to validate all tickets from the same reservation at once

## Viewing Ticket Details

For each ticket, you can:

1. See the ticket status (scanned or not scanned)
2. View the customer information
3. Check the event details
4. See any additional options selected

## PDF Ticket Display

You can view and download the PDF version of any ticket:

1. Find the ticket in the list
2. Click the "PDF" button in the actions column
3. The ticket PDF will open in a new tab or download automatically

This is useful for reprinting tickets or verifying ticket details.

## Correcting Scanning Errors

If a ticket was scanned by mistake, you can "de-scan" it:

1. Find the scanned ticket in the list
2. Click the "Unscan" button in the actions column
3. The ticket status will revert to "Not Scanned"

This feature is particularly helpful for correcting errors during event check-in.

## Managing Reservations

In the **Reservations** section, you can:

1. View all valid reservations
2. See the number of tickets in each reservation
3. Send tickets again via email if needed
4. Filter reservations by event, validity status, date, or options
