# Create a post  

**Create your tickets and manage your reservations with ease! **  

If you are hosting an event with limited number of seats, paying or requiring a free reservation, connect these reservations directly to your events for optimal follow-up and smooth participant management.  

Creating a ticket or booking works like a membership, with an additional feature detailed below to enrich your event management.  


## Steps to create  

- Reservations are to be created in the category **"Products"** in the left column under the tab **"Products"**.  
- Click the **"ADD PRODUCTS +"** button.  
- Fill in the general information ("General" tab):  
  - **Ticket Name** (ex: *Mama Africa Ticket*).  
  - **Product type** : Select **"Ticket for Paid Booking"***.  
  -**Name**: Activate this button to display the **first name** on the ticket.  
  - **Short description** (*optional*).  
  - **Long description** (*optional*).  
  - **Image**: Import an image.  
  - **Weight**: Determines the order in which the banknotes appear (from lighter to heavier).  
  - **Single Choice**: Select only one option (*optional*).  
  - **Multiple Choice**: Allows you to select multiple options (*optional*).  
  - **Link to a legal notice** (*optional*).  
  - **Post**: Activate this button to display the booking in the event description page.
