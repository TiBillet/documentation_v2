Article categories are useful for:
- Organize items by type on the cash register interface.
- Set background color and icon to match item.
- Classify items for preparation. For example, for printing orders in the kitchen or at the bar.

## Create a new article category

Go to the “Article categories” menu in the left-hand column.
- Click on “Add category” at top right.
- Enter the category name, choose a color for the text and background.
- Select an icon to appear on the cash register interface.
- Click on “Save”.
  - All icons are listed on [https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/](https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/)

Your item category has now been created! Now all you have to do is register your items, define their prices and associate them with this category.
If your partners (exhibitors, artists, musicians, etc.) have a reduced price, you can create a dedicated category to save time.
