# Table management and order tracking in the admin area

Before taking orders, you can add and organize your tables in the “Table” section of the menu in the left-hand column.

Once you've placed an order, you'll be able to find it in the “Orders” section, along with all the relevant information:

- Table name (e.g. Table 1, Ext 1)
- Order status (paid, served, pending...)
- Name of person responsible for order
- List of items ordered
- Order date
- Amount still to pay (if applicable)
- Order identifier (Order ID)
- Service identifier (Service ID)
- Ticket number

This gives you an overview and helps you track the status of orders in progress.

## Add a table

If you need to add a table, follow these steps:

- Go to the “Table” menu in the left-hand column.
- Click on “Add table” in the top right-hand corner.
- Assign a name to the table (e.g. Table 1, Terrace 2).
- Associate it with a category, if necessary.
- Define its status:
  - Free: if the table is available.
  - Occupied: if a customer has just set up.

- Additional option:
  - Ephemeral table: Check “Ephemeral” if the table is temporary (e.g. added for a group of customers).
  - Archive: Archive the table if it is no longer in use.

**Once saved, the table will be available in the order management interface.**

# Order management on the cash register

Once you've set up your tables, you can start taking orders directly from your cash register or phone.

Steps to take an order :

- Access the “Point of sale” menu in the top right-hand corner.
- Select the outlet where your menu is located (e.g. Resto).
- Choose your service mode:
  - Direct service: the order is taken and paid for immediately.
  - Order with shipment in preparation: directly select the occupied table.
- Add products ordered.
- Confirm total.
- Choose a shipping option:
  - Send to preparation: the order is sent to the kitchen/bar.
  - Send in preparation and pay in one go.
  - Send in preparation and go to the payment page (convenient for separate payment).

This enables smooth order management and efficient preparation tracking.
