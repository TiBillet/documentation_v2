The breakdown is used to correct a payment error when a purchase has been recorded using 
**the wrong means of payment**.

**⚠️ This only applies to cash, credit card and cheque payments.**

Cashless card payment methods (including cashless gifts) cannot be changed, unlike other payment methods, which can be selected incorrectly at the time of collection.

Change the payment method and save.

## 3) If the cash register has already been closed, you can relaunch the cash register calculation by going to the corresponding menu :
- Follow the above procedure, because even if the till is closed, you will still have access to its sales in the “sales” tab in the left-hand column, in order to correct any errors.
- Click on the "Cash desk closing" category in the left-hand column.
- Click on the "reload" button in the "action" section.
- The payment method used is now updated in the checkout.
- You can check this by clicking on "ticketZ" in the "action" section.

:::note

Warning: It is forbidden to delete a sold item, as this is an illegal practice. It is preferable to add a comment on the item concerned, which will be taken into account by the accountant.

For refunds, see the Refund section.

# Terminal management 

You can also manage the breakdown of means of payment directly on the terminal **if your primary card has the "Manager"** option (see primary card).

This feature allows you to rectify means of payment in real time, without the need for computer access.

:::note

This case is convenient for changing the payment method for the entire order. However, if the change concerns only one item, it should be made using the first method.
