## Select and delete orders

Rather than going through Manager mode to delete unserved or unpaid orders, it is possible to delete them all at once from the admin interface.

In the administration of your TiBillet cashless instance, go to the SALES / Orders menu.
Filter the commands using the drop-down menu (by table, by status, etc.).
Select them one by one or all at once with the menu radio button to the left of TABLE.

In the drop-down menu at the bottom left of SEND, select "Delete Orders".

Attention ! There will be no confirmation and there will be no going back.
