## Reward large top-ups online.

We have implemented a gift token cashback system following requests from our customers.

The idea is to encourage people to carry out their own recharges online 
to relieve a site's cashless reception and recharge points.

In the administration of your cashless page, go to "General Configuration", then to the "CASHBACK" tab.
Indicate the amount from which the reward activates, the value of the reward, then activate the box "Activate cashback for top-ups".
Finally, validate with the “Save” button.

Result: Each time you reload more than the planned amount, “Gift” tokens are credited to the card.

Please note that these “Gift” tokens are considered differently by accounting 
and do not enter into the profit calculation figures (same currency as for volunteers, for example).

### Example :

For example :

- Cashback start = 50
- Cashback value = 2.50

If the person tops up €55, they earn 2.50 as a gift.
If she tops up €101, she wins 5 as a gift (x2).
