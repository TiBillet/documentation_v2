## Reward large top-ups online.

We have implemented a gift token cashback system following requests from our customers.

The idea is to encourage people to carry out their own recharges online 
to relieve a site's cashless reception and recharge points.

In the administration :
- Go to "General Configuration" in the left-hand column, then to the "CASHBACK" tab.
- Indicate the amount from which the reward activates and the value of the reward
- Then activate the box "Activate cashback for top-ups".
- Save

Result: Each time you reload more than the planned amount, “Gift” tokens are credited to the card.

Please note that these “Gift” tokens are considered differently by accounting 
and do not enter into the profit calculation figures (same currency as for volunteers, for example).

### Example :

For example :

- Cashback start = 50
- Cashback value = 2.50

If the person tops up €55, they earn 2.50 as a gift.
If she tops up €101, she wins 5 as a gift (x2).

## Cashback exchange from credit card to cash

The cashback system can also be used if your customers tend to ask you for change (e.g. cash payment for exhibitors).

Follow the instructions :

:::note

Please note: with this method, you'll need to specify in your accounting that Cashbach means that the money has been returned. For each exchange, a gain of 0.50 centimes is realized, to allow for bank commission.
