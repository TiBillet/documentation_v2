Primary cards are required to open a point of sale (Android or terminal). They determine the level 
of authorization available to the user: For example, you can authorize access to a "BAR" 
point of sale without giving access to the "CASHLESS" point of sale which allows recharges.

Always prefer to add named primary cards (linked to a user). This way, you will be able to trace each transaction more precisely.
The person responsible for the point of sale is visible in each payment.

## 1- Register a new member.

- Click on the "Members" category in the left column.
- Click on the "Add Member" button at the top right.
- You can add or not an associative membership.
- Enter the new card number in the corresponding field.
- Save.
- 
## 2- Create the primary card.

- Click on the “Master Cards” category in the left menu.
- Click on the "Add Primary Card" button at the top right.
- Enter the card number.
- Designate the points of sale controlled (or not) by this card.
     - Here you can determine the level of authorization your user has.
- Activate manager mode if you wish.
     - “Manager mode” allows you to cancel an order already placed, even if it is paid. It's a superpower that requires great responsibilities :)
- Save.

## 3- Test the card at a point of sale

- Start the TiBillet application on a terminal or smartphone.
     - Follow the [pairing procedure](/docs/User/Cashless/android) if you have not already done so.
- Scan the card when requested by the app.
- Check that you only have the points of sale associated with the card.
