Primary cards are required to open a point of sale (Android or terminal). They determine the level 
of authorization available to the user: For example, you can authorize access to a "BAR" 
point of sale without giving access to the "CASHLESS" point of sale which allows recharges.

Always prefer to add named primary cards (linked to a user). This way, you will be able to trace each transaction more precisely.
The person responsible for the point of sale is visible in each payment.

## 1- Register a new responsible member.

- Click on the "Members" category in the left column.
- Click on the "Add Member" button at the top right.
- Enter the new card number in the corresponding field.
- Save.

We are talking here about authorization level, not associative membership.

## 2- Create the primary card.

- Click on the “Primary Cards” category in the left menu.
- Click on the "Add Primary Card" button at the top right.
- Enter the card number.
- Designate the points of sale controlled (or not) by this card.
     - Here you can determine the level of authorization your user has.
- Activate manager mode if you wish.
     - “Manager mode” allows you to cancel an order already placed, even if it is paid. It's a superpower that requires great responsibilities :
- Save.

A member can have several primary cards provided that they did not enter an email address when creating the member in section 1.

## 3- Test the card at a point of sale

- Launch the TiBillet application on a terminal or smartphone equipped with an NFC reader.
     - Follow the [pairing procedure](cf. Android application) if you haven't already.
- Scan the card when prompted.
- If you don't see your point of sale, check that the points of sale are associated with the card.
- You can now access your products.
