# Create a membership  

In order to meet the various demands of associations and third-party venues, we have developed several types of products, namely :  
   - Ticket reservation
   - Free reservations
   - Subscription
   - Badges  

These memberships are to be created in the **"Products ‘** category in the left-hand column under the **’Products ”** tab.  

### Here's how :  

- Click on the **“ADD PRODUCTS +”** button  
- Fill in the general information (“General” tab):  
  - Enter the name of the membership (e.g. *Tenderness Membership 2025*).  
  - Choose the product type **"Subscription ”**.  
  - Enter a **short description** (*optional*).  
  - Enter a **long description** (*optional*).  
  - Import product image.  
  - Weight**: Allows you to choose the order in which your tickets appear (from lightest to heaviest).  
  - Single-choice menu**: Only one choice can be selected at the time of ordering. 
  - Multiple choice menu**: Several choices can be selected at the time of ordering. (*optional*).  
  - Add a **link to a legal notice** (*optional*).  
  - Activate the **"Publish ”** button to display the membership in **Lespass > Join**.  
  - Activate the **"Archive ”** button to delete your membership.
- **Save**
